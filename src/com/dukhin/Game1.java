//Plan for games:
	/*
	 * going to probably have some sort of game interface. In main class, just a conditional, if an arraylist of games is empty-> final boss time
	 * I will have console commands which can skip to the desired games. The player can replay games to gain more clues to unlock the next series of games and clues.
	 * Main class(One.java) will house basic input handling and will create instances of the games for the player. Should have an update method with some sort of reciteQuery override for the game temporarily or something.
	 * Don't know exactly how the query handling will work for the individual game instances.
